## Usage

### Mongo Explorer

![Browser](https://github.com/dboissier/mongo4idea/raw/master/doc/mongo4idea-explorerWithDB.png)

For each server, the tree displays its databases with all of their collections.

* To edit or remove the server, right-click and select the appropriate action from the server node.
* To view the content of your server, just double-click on it.
* To view the content of a collection, double-click on it (or type `F4`) and the results will be displayed in an editor tab, alongside your open files.
If you double-click on another collection, a new tab will be created for it.

If you want clear a collection or database, you can do so by right clicking on it and selecting **Drop collection/database** (shortcut is `DELETE`). Be cautious with this operation, it should not be used in a production environment.


**[NEW]** 
* When selecting a database or a collection, you will see the `stats` in the below panel
* When selecting a collection, you can import JSON file by right-clicking and selecting `Import data` menu item. Select your JSON file and click on `Replace all content` option if needed.
* When selecting a server, you can copy its configuration

### Mongo collection tab view

The panel shows all documents of the collections (max 300 records by default).

![Collection view](https://github.com/dboissier/mongo4idea/raw/master/doc/mongo4idea_collectionResults.png)

You can copy the result and paste it in a text editor.

If you want to see the results in a table view instead, click on the **Table** icon on the right of the toolbar.

![Collection view](https://github.com/dboissier/mongo4idea/raw/master/doc/mongo4idea_tableView.png)

**[NEW]** You can paginate the results by selecting the number of the documents per page below the results. You will be able to navigate with `[<-]``and `[->]` icon

#### Querying

If you want to run a *find* query, click on the Magnifying glass icon or use the `CTRL+F` shortcut.

The query panel will appear at the top.

Type your filter, projection or sort query fragment in JSON format (e.g.: `{ 'name': 'foo'}`)

If you want to run some aggregate queries, type your pipeline as follows:
```js
{'$operator1': {...}},
{'$operator2': {...}}
```

![Aggregate query view](https://github.com/dboissier/mongo4idea/raw/master/doc/mongo4idea-queryAggregate.png)

Typing `CTRL+SPACE` displays a popup that allows you to select a query operator.

Additionally, you can set a row limit.

When you are done, click on the Run button (or type `CTRL+ENTER` shortcut) to see the query results.
